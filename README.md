<!-- ## Hi there 👋 -->
## 👋 Hi there, welcome to my GitHub!

No grand plan here — just experiments, half-finished ideas, and things I build for fun.

💡 I like tinkering with code, scripts, and random concepts just to see what happens.
🧩 Sometimes it works. Sometimes... not so much, but that’s part of the fun.
📂 You’ll find a bit of everything here — prototypes, tests, and projects I might finish one day.
